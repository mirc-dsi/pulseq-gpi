function s=compressShape(w)
%compressShape Compress a gradient or pulse shape.
%   s=compressShape(w) Compress the waveform using a run-length compression
%   scheme on the derivative. This strategy encodes constant and linear
%   waveforms with very few samples. A structure is returned with the
%   fields: 
%     num_samples - the number of samples in the uncompressed waveform
%     data - containing the compressed waveform
